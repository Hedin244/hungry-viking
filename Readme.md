Todo:
* Game mechanics (like player speed) should change with game screen size to be similar  in difficulty.
* Level is becoming too complicated, food logic, key handlers and background should probably go to their own classes.
* Score and Health should be in Level and LevelUI should only handle displaying them.
* Some assets could be loaded in Game (to be fair writing an assets' manager that would manage that and load assets as needed in bundles would be best).

Visual changes needed:
* Better information boxes (pause, start, etc.).
* Background resizing doesn't work correctly.

Possible Game upgrades:
* Introduce difference in food types, different values, bombs etc.
* Add sprint option for a player (manageable resource)
* Add different levels and upgrade system between them (player speed, health, etc.)
